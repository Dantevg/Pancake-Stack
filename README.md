# Pancake-Stack
This is an implementation of the esoteric programming language *Pancake Stack*, written in Lua.
Its description can be found on the [Esolang wiki](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Pancake_Stack).

### Additions
I added the possibility for comments with a configurable syntax. By default,
a comment is anything between brackets at the end of a line:
```
(this is a comment)
Put this heavenly pancake on top! (this is also a comment)
Put syrup on (this is not a comment) the pancakes!
```
